<h1> Purpose: </h1>
<p>
The purpose of this exercise was I had an inkling to iterate on the code I made during an exercise. I proactively wanted to optimize and make the code better even if it was just an assessment. The drive to make it better was formulated as in the instance I made it originally I didn't have access to any internet. By being able to use the internet making n-ary trees became much easier! : D <
